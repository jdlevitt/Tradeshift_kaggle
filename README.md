This code is mostly NOT my own.  It was shared by a Dmitry Dryomov at http://www.kaggle.com/c/tradeshift-text-classification/forums/t/10629/benchmark-with-sklearn.
All tuning was done my me however.

For the competition, I ran this a 16 core AWS instance, but it ran out of memory running the final tree.  I estimate from my CV scores that this may have placed in the top 30.
